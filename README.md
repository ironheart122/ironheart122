# From Idea to MVPâ€”Fast, Lean, and Built to Scale

Iâ€™m your no-BS fractional CTO who doesnâ€™t nickel-and-dime you for equity. I turn startup dreams into MVPs that launch strong, scale smooth, and keep your cash in check. Speed and cost? Non-negotiable. Ideas become revenue-makers in weeks â€”not monthsâ€” because bootstrappers donâ€™t have time to mess around.

## What You Get

- Mobile apps & sites: Slick, sturdy, user-approved.
- Backend: Clean, reliable, no jank.
- Payments: Cards, crypto, done quick.
- AI: Useful, not hype-y.
- Analytics: Real insights, no guesswork.

Iâ€™ve shipped MVPs that handled $50k+ in transactions and 100+ users without blinking. My go-to stack: AWS, Cloudflare, TypeScript, React, Next.js, PostgreSQL, Stripe, Posthog, Supabase, NeonDB, AWS DynamoDBâ€”reliable tools that just work.

ðŸš€ Scalability & killer UI/UX baked in from day one.
ðŸ’¡ Hunting Product-Market Fit? Weâ€™ll launch fast, tweak faster, and skip the dev-cycle cash bonfire. Pure results, no fluff.
